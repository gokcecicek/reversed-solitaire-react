GSM operators always have applications such as raffles, games etc.(e.g Salla Kazan, Hediye √áarkƒ±), why not such an application in e-commerce sites? For this, I made the Reversed Spider Solitaire game with a Trendyol theme.

 ## Happy Path
 
- The user wins a game coupon for every purchase of 150 TL or more.
- If user finishes the game, the user gets a place on the leaderboard.
- At the end of the month, the user with the highest score wins the surprise gift.
- To get more chances, you can shop again and win one more coupon.
